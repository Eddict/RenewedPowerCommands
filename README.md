# PowerCommands Renewed for Visual Studio 2022

## PowerCommands Renewed
Microsoft DevLabs provided a nice set of Power Commands, but stopped supporting them with Visual Studio 2022.
They say it's because some of them have now been baked-in to the product. While that may be true, some beloved
commands from that extension are no longer available. So, this extension project's aim is to bring them back.
The first ones I've added are listed below.

Individual power commands can be enabled or disabled from the Power Commands Renewed page in
Tools -> Options in Visual Studio. Some Power Commands are enabled by default. Below is a list of the
commands included in Power Commands Renewed for Visual Studio 2012.

### Format document on save 
Enables formatting of tabs, spaces and other characters in a document to be saved. It is equivalent to using
Format Document command under the Edit->Advanced menu. Disabled by default.

### Remove and Sort Usings on save 
Removes unused using statements and sorts the remaining using statements in the C# document being saved.
Disabled by default. 

### Collapse Projects
Collapses a project or projects in the Solution Explorer starting from the root selected node. This option
resides in three different places on the Solution Explorer: Solution, Solution folders and Project nodes.

### Remove and Sort Usings
Removes and sort using statements for all classes given a project. It is useful, for example, in removing or
organizing the using statements generated by a wizard. This command can be executed from a solution node or a
single project node.
